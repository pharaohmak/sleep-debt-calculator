# Sleep Debt Calculator

This project is a simple browser-based tool that calculates your sleep debt based on the actual and ideal hours of sleep. The tool is implemented in JavaScript and dynamically displays the results on a webpage.

## Project Description

The Sleep Debt Calculator allows users to input their actual sleep hours for the week and their ideal daily sleep hours. The tool then calculates the total actual sleep hours, the total ideal sleep hours, and the sleep debt. It informs the user if they are getting the ideal amount of sleep, extra sleep, or if they are in a sleep deficit.
